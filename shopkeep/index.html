Haven't had much time to code in the past couple of days, but I did manage to write the basic save/load/new game functions, although I'll be adding most of the vital game information libraries as I go.  I've been thinking a lot about how to store this information, and feel comfortable enough to move forward.<br>
<br>
Still heavily mulling over gameplay functionality, display, and UI.  I pretty much just now remembered that it might be a good idea to be able to use a mouse, rather than having just keyboard input.  Perhaps I could model the gameplay after Fallout 1 & 2 (but with very different graphics and many more and better interaction menus/windows).

Intended to spend most of the day coding parts of the game, but spent more time than anticipated creating a piece of pixel art (the 64 x 64px tile which now graces the background of this website).  Although this was my first real experience in creating pixel-art, and it was actually a lot more fun and successful than I'd anticipated.  I may want to employ this method to some extent in creating sprites for SK, so it was time well spent.  I also launched this website, obviously, and spent just enough time on it for it to be passable; at some point in the not-too-distant future I'll probably bootstrap it with a custom theme, add some js libraries and automation (right now I'm directly editing the html), and give it some relative sizing options (because it doesn't look great on my phone).  I'm also open to style suggestions.<br>
<br>
I was able to get a little bit of game coding done, too, adding a Menu class to store relevant data for any menu in the game, and small function to display and execute that data which will change once I add graphics.  The point is that the menu classes won't need to change, so I can feel comfortable coding that stuff without worrying about the possibility of having to scrap it all later.

Today I started working on some pixel art, which will become the background for this dev log page.  It was also meant to be an experiment in my creating pixel art... and it was pretty fun.  I may hand draw the sprites in a very simple pixellated way.

"Shopkeep" (SK) is a single-player simulation game with RPG elements, in which the player's character (PC) owns and operates a weapon shop in a medieval fantasy (~1400 AD) town.<br>
<br>
"<a href="http://bay12games.com/dwarves">Dwarf Fortress</a>" is my primary inspiration regarding the development of game mechanics, but the idea for the game itself came from a misunderstanding from the (still in early-access) game "<a href="http://townsgame.com">Towns</a>."  Towns is a very cool game, and I hope it continues to be developed, but my comprehension of whatever description I read about the game before I purchased it did not match the game itself.  The premise of Shopkeep is my attempt realize that concept which I happily fabricated.<br>
<br>
I have many decisions to make about the game, both technically and artistically, and I'll use this space to rubber-duck some of those thoughts, and make it public at some point if only for the sake of receiving constructive feedback.<br>
<br>
<br>
-- Running a shop?  How is that fun? --<br>
<br>
Imagine an adventurer coming in and buying a really nice axe, spending all her money on it because she wants to go fight a dragon and knows she'll either die or come back with untold riches.  Then later another adventurer comes in and buys various ranged weapons, intending to seek his fortune but at a safe distance.  Then another one comes in, the stealthy type and a bit more experienced, and just buys a new dagger.  A few days later, the third adventurer comes back and says, "Hey... what'll you give me for this nice axe and these throwing weapons I found by some mauled corpses in the dragon's lair?"<br>
<br>
Pretty much all the action occurs within the shop.  The PC doesn't go adventuring, doesn't have a dexterity score or hit points, and can't die.  Rather than going out there and risking her neck for a piece of gold, she lets the gold come to her.  The world will contain heroes and adventuring aplenty... but it all occurs off-screen.<br>
<br>
A fantasy-setting weapon is more than just an economic commodity, and this will be reflected in each item's history.  If a weapon manages to be sold back to the shop after changing hands several times, it may very well have been owned by some famous heroes, have killed some legendary monsters, and been a part of some dramatic event which storytellers will be narrating for centuries.  And while it's awesome to know that your shop displays the iron flail which Sir Soandsuch used to crush the skull of the great red dragon which had once terrorized the countryside... imagine how much someone would pay for such a thing.  Or maybe you can just tell the poor sucker that it's the same sword; maybe they'll be gullible enough to believe you.  Or maybe they live in town and, upon realizing your charade, hire some local thugs to do some damage to your lovely storefront.<br>
<br>
I have a lot planned, and that's just the start of it -- enough so you know what this game is all about.  I think it best to reveal more as I code it.<br>
<br>
<br>
-- Technical Stuff --<br>
<br>
After sufficient deliberation, I have decided to code the game in Python.  Although a compiled language would result in a "faster" game, I do not anticipate anything that will result in a struggling FPS rate.  This is a pet project, and while I use Visual Studio and C# in my day job, I'd rather unwind with a little Python on my personal time.  Python's just more fun, I don't have to fuss with an IDE, and I'm fairly familiar with it already.  That said, I plan to take pains to keep parts of the game distinct from one another, in case I decide to use something else, for example, to render graphics.<br>
<br>
Speaking of graphics, SK will be 2-D top-down.  I mentioned that I'm a Dwarf Fortress fan, and that includes the Code Page 437 tileset.  I'm not a graphics person, so while in development SK is going the same route and simply printing ANSI characters to the console.  I am not certain if I want the game to be tile-based (e.g. Dwarf Fortress, early Final Fantasy games) or more free-form, although right now I am leaning toward a Legends of Zelda feel where there are fixed tile-like sprites on a grid which the PC and any NPCs may fluidly navigate around.  But this is not an action/adventure game, and the means in which actions are taken would be a flourish, not a feature; so for the time being I can simply code in text-based menus and worry about the visuals later.<br>
