Although I programmed myself into a corner tying to figure out how to assign these Joint objects to their appropriate Component objects, I believe this has ultimately led to an unintended innovation.  Rather than assemble components with joints into a weapon using a predetermined weapon type template, I have created component classes which know that they are only able to have connections to other specific classes.  In this way, if this works the way I think it will, my function which assembles components into weapons will simply take whatever components I give it and connect the pieces in a way that makes sense.  Once it's been created, I'll make a function that identifies it as a sword, axe, bow, what-have-you.  This way of doing things paves the road for all sorts of possibilities as I add more components to the master list.  What sorts of things would you like to attach to the ends of the flails you make?  How many axe blades would you like to attach to your elm haft?  Will have to start thinking about upper limits, and start adding some mass to materials and volume to components.

<br>
I've created joints to join the different components of a weapon.  Once a joint is destroyed, the weapon would fall apart.  I ran into some trouble in actually attaching joints to their appropriate components, which I plan on resolving in the next couple of days.  I may need to rethink part of my weapon system to account for partial weapons (e.g. a flail with a handle and chain but a missing ball).<br>
<br>
What's perhaps more exciting, however, is that I've created a rudimentary Hero class embodying personality, experience, and perceptions.  Right now personality is composed of eight different traits, many of which will be applicable in battle, but all of which will play into the hero's decision-making while at your shop.  And although the shopkeep herself has no inherent personality traits (you get to play her however you wish), each hero contains its own instance of how it perceives the shopkeep's personality, which will not only affect how the hero interacts with you but also what the hero will tell others about you, affecting your overall reputation.<br>
<br>
I also laid the basic foundation for the player class and the economy class.  Each hero will also hold its own instance of a perceived economy, meaning scenarios could come into play where you could convince an out-of-towner that a weapon made of copper is actually immensely valuable.<br>
<br>
Going to finish joints and add a little more to the weapons class next, and then on to filling in the player class.

As usual, not nearly as much time to code on my set-aside "coding day," but even so, it is immensely satisfying.  Today I successfully created a weapon class, with each weapon being composed of several components, each of which being composed of a material.  I had to create a foundation for my dictionaries of possible weapon types, components, and materials, and so my first successful attempt at using my Weapon().generate() function made a shortsword with an ash hilt, a steel blade, and a bronze scabbard.  At this point, the dictionaries only have a meager number of material, component, and weapon options (okay, truthfully, it only makes shortswords right now), but even so, my second generation manifested a sword with a hickory hilt, steel blade, and ash scabbard.  Adding new weapons and components at this point is just a matter of data entry.<br>
<br>
Now that the basis for the existence of weapons is in place, it's time to make heroes...  Oh, and the player herself, I suppose.

Haven't had much time to code in the past couple of days, but I did manage to write the basic save/load/new game functions, although I'll be adding most of the vital game information libraries as I go.  I've been thinking a lot about how to store this information, and feel comfortable enough to move forward.<br>
<br>
Still heavily mulling over gameplay functionality, display, and UI.  I pretty much just now remembered that it might be a good idea to be able to use a mouse, rather than having just keyboard input.  Perhaps I could model the gameplay after Fallout 1 & 2 (but with very different graphics and many more and better interaction menus/windows).

Intended to spend most of the day coding parts of the game, but spent more time than anticipated creating a piece of pixel art (the 64 x 64px tile which now graces the background of this website).  Although this was my first real experience in creating pixel-art, and it was actually a lot more fun and successful than I'd anticipated.  I may want to employ this method to some extent in creating sprites for SK, so it was time well spent.  I also launched this website, obviously, and spent just enough time on it for it to be passable; at some point in the not-too-distant future I'll probably bootstrap it with a custom theme, add some js libraries and automation (right now I'm directly editing the html), and give it some relative sizing options (because it doesn't look great on my phone).  I'm also open to style suggestions.<br>
<br>
I was able to get a little bit of game coding done, too, adding a Menu class to store relevant data for any menu in the game, and small function to display and execute that data which will change once I add graphics.  The point is that the menu classes won't need to change, so I can feel comfortable coding that stuff without worrying about the possibility of having to scrap it all later.

Today I started working on some pixel art, which will become the background for this dev log page.  It was also meant to be an experiment in my creating pixel art... and it was pretty fun.  I may hand draw the sprites in a very simple pixellated way.

"Shopkeep" (SK) is a single-player simulation game with RPG elements, in which the player's character (PC) owns and operates a weapon shop in a medieval fantasy (~1400 AD) town.<br>
<br>
"<a href="http://bay12games.com/dwarves">Dwarf Fortress</a>" is my primary inspiration regarding the development of game mechanics, but the idea for the game itself came from a misunderstanding from the (still in early-access) game "<a href="http://townsgame.com">Towns</a>."  Towns is a very cool game, and I hope it continues to be developed, but my comprehension of whatever description I read about the game before I purchased it did not match the game itself.  The premise of Shopkeep is my attempt realize that concept which I happily fabricated.<br>
<br>
I have many decisions to make about the game, both technically and artistically, and I'll use this space to rubber-duck some of those thoughts, and make it public at some point if only for the sake of receiving constructive feedback.<br>
<br>
<br>
-- Running a shop?  How is that fun? --<br>
<br>
Imagine an adventurer coming in and buying a really nice axe, spending all her money on it because she wants to go fight a dragon and knows she'll either die or come back with untold riches.  Then later another adventurer comes in and buys various ranged weapons, intending to seek his fortune but at a safe distance.  Then another one comes in, the stealthy type and a bit more experienced, and just buys a new dagger.  A few days later, the third adventurer comes back and says, "Hey... what'll you give me for this nice axe and these throwing weapons I found by some mauled corpses in the dragon's lair?"<br>
<br>
Pretty much all the action occurs within the shop.  The PC doesn't go adventuring, doesn't have a dexterity score or hit points, and can't die.  Rather than going out there and risking her neck for a piece of gold, she lets the gold come to her.  The world will contain heroes and adventuring aplenty... but it all occurs off-screen.<br>
<br>
A fantasy-setting weapon is more than just an economic commodity, and this will be reflected in each item's history.  If a weapon manages to be sold back to the shop after changing hands several times, it may very well have been owned by some famous heroes, have killed some legendary monsters, and been a part of some dramatic event which storytellers will be narrating for centuries.  And while it's awesome to know that your shop displays the iron flail which Sir Soandsuch used to crush the skull of the great red dragon which had once terrorized the countryside... imagine how much someone would pay for such a thing.  Or maybe you can just tell the poor sucker that it's the same sword; maybe they'll be gullible enough to believe you.  Or maybe they live in town and, upon realizing your charade, hire some local thugs to do some damage to your lovely storefront.<br>
<br>
I have a lot planned, and that's just the start of it -- enough so you know what this game is all about.  I think it best to reveal more as I code it.<br>
<br>
<br>
-- Technical Stuff --<br>
<br>
After sufficient deliberation, I have decided to code the game in Python.  Although a compiled language would result in a "faster" game, I do not anticipate anything that will result in a struggling FPS rate.  This is a pet project, and while I use Visual Studio and C# in my day job, I'd rather unwind with a little Python on my personal time.  Python's just more fun, I don't have to fuss with an IDE, and I'm fairly familiar with it already.  That said, I plan to take pains to keep parts of the game distinct from one another, in case I decide to use something else, for example, to render graphics.<br>
<br>
Speaking of graphics, SK will be 2-D top-down.  I mentioned that I'm a Dwarf Fortress fan, and that includes the Code Page 437 tileset.  I'm not a graphics person, so while in development SK is going the same route and simply printing ANSI characters to the console.  I am not certain if I want the game to be tile-based (e.g. Dwarf Fortress, early Final Fantasy games) or more free-form, although right now I am leaning toward a Legends of Zelda feel where there are fixed tile-like sprites on a grid which the PC and any NPCs may fluidly navigate around.  But this is not an action/adventure game, and the means in which actions are taken would be a flourish, not a feature; so for the time being I can simply code in text-based menus and worry about the visuals later.<br>
